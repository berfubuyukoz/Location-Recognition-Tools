the O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O

if O

that O

needed O
it O
should O
be O

by O
the O
European B-ORG

. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

by O
EU B-ORG
Farm O
Commissioner O
Franz O

to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O
and O
spinal O

from O
the O
human O

animal O
food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler O
proposed O
EU-wide B-LOC
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain B-LOC
and O
France B-LOC
that O
under O

But O
Fischler O
agreed O

his O
proposal O
after O
the O

standing O
veterinary O

mational O

questioned O
if O

in O
the O

Looming O
in O

is O
a O

third-round O
date O

who O
took O
out O

in O
the O
third O

of O
the O
Australian B-LOC

. O

Sampras O
avenged O
that O
defeat O
with O
a O
straight O
sets O
win O
over O
the O
19-year-old O
power O
hitter O
in O
the O
second O

at O

their O

provide O
some O

only O
a O

final O
with O

Bumping O
Agassi O
up O
to O
the O
sixth O

avoided O
the O
possibility O
that O
he O
would O
run O
into O
Sampras O

" O
The O

" O
Volkova O

A O

A O

the O

such O
as O

Coughlan O

the O

had O
more O

with O
Haga O
briefly O
taking O
the O

But O
Takeda O
found O
one O

spurt O
of O
power O
to O
just O
take O
the O
flag O
first O
with O
Haga O
second O
and O
Yoshikawa O

In O
the O

Takeda O
again O
challenged O
strongly O
until O
the O

from O
the O
end O
when O
he O
crashed O
while O

Aoki O
, O
the O

had O
a O
race-long O

of O
the O
United B-LOC

a O
Ducati B-ORG
before O
taking O

who O
recorded O
the O

With O
Takeda O

, O
Kocinski O
regained O

but O
he O
could O
not O

was O
the O
unlucky O

But O
the O

A O
super O
piece O
of O
fielding O
by O
Lewis O
, O
dropped O
as O
a O
disciplinary O
measure O
after O
arriving O
only O
35 O
minutes O
before O
the O
start O
on O
the O
fourth O
morning O
, O
provided O
the O
only O
bright O
spot O
for O
England B-LOC
as O
the O
touring O
team O
batted O
on O
to O
reach O
413 O
for O
five O
at O
the O
interval O
, O
a O
lead O
of O
87 O
. O

The O
solitary O
wicket O
to O
fall O
was O
Asif O
Mujtaba O
, O
run O
out O
for O
13 O
attempting O
a O
second O
run O
to O
third O
man O
where O
Lewis O
was O
lurking O
with O
a O
point O
to O
prove O
. O

There O
seemed O
scant O
danger O
until O
the O
Surrey B-ORG
player O
swooped O
on O
to O
the O
ball O
and O
returned O
off O
balance O
to O
county O
team O
mate O
Alec O
Stewart O
who O
whipped O
off O
the O
bails O
. O

Lewis O
, O
though O
, O
could O
not O
make O
similar O
waves O
with O
the O
ball O
as O
Salim O
Malik O
and O
Wasim O
Akram O
batted O
through O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
session O
with O
few O
alarms O
. O

Wasim O
rattled O
along O
to O
30 O
not O
out O
, O
outscoring O
his O
partner O
who O
was O
unbeaten O
on O
24 O
at O
the O
break O
, O
although O
the O
weather O
was O
again O
threatening O
to O
play O
the O
dominant O
role O
. O

Rain O
arrived O
just O
as O
the O
players O
left O
the O
field O
for O
lunch O
, O
forcing O
the O
ground-staff O
into O
action O
yet O
again O
. O

The O
weather O
delayed O
the O
resumption O

over O
an O
hour O

the O

that O
those O

would O
testify O
only O

" O

" O

" O

That O

open O
their O

" O

The O
commission O
, O
which O
has O
the O
power O
to O
grant O
amnesty O
to O
those O
who O
confess O

, O
has O
begun O
hearing O
the O

from O

already O
in O

But O
others O
, O
such O
as O
self-confessed O
secret O

, O
have O

. O

Tutu O

, O
Alex O
Boraine O
, O
told O

the O

would O
begin O
issuing O
subpoenas O
to O
suspects O
who O
refused O
to O

voluntarily O
some O

this O

He O
added O
that O

be O
among O
those O
called O

But O
Currin O
, O
who O

advising O
several O

regarded O

said O
this O
was O
not O
the O

" O
A O
person O
can O
be O
forced O
to O

, O
but O
the O
only O
way O
one O
is O
going O
to O
get O
to O
the O
truth O
in O
its O
totality O
is O
if O
people O
feel O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
go O
to O
the O

committee O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
this O
is O
not O
the O

He O

Coetzee O

was O
charged O

His O
trial O
is O
due O

in O
December O
but O
the O
truth O
commission O
intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin O
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O
so O
all O
judicial O
prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O

Boraine O
said O
the O

was O
incomplete O
because O

of O
the O

had O
yet O
to O

but O
one O

" O
This O
whole O

is O
utterly O
useless O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
help O

at O
all O

What O
the O

is O
to O

" O

Political O

he O

which O
implemented O
apartheid O

began O
dismantling O
it O

felt O
it O
carried O
a O
burden O
of O
guilt O
and O
needed O
to O
be O
exculpated O
through O
the O

" O
Therefore O
I O
have O
some O
doubts O
about O
achieving O
some O
form O
of O

One O

The O

It O
was O

Stich O
, O
not O

benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O

himself O
after O

after O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
fighting O
of O
the O

Lebed O
may O
be O
just O
finding O
out O
that O
concluding O
a O
long-term O

somewhere O
between O
rebel O
demands O
for O

and O
Moscow B-LOC

insistence O
that O
Chechnya B-LOC
remain O
part O
of O
Russia B-LOC

will O
be O
no O

A O
chain-smoking O
former O

general O
with O
a O
sharp O
line O
in O
deadpan O
putdowns O
and O
a O
soldier O
's O
knack O
for O
making O
life O
sound O
simple O
, O
Lebed O
managed O
to O
arrange O
an O
ambitious O
ceasefire O
in O
the O
region O
last O
week O
, O
days O
after O
the O
Russian B-LOC
army O
threatened O
to O
bomb O
its O
way O
back O
into O
the O
rebel-held O
Chechen B-LOC
capital O
Grozny B-LOC

He O
returned O
at O
the O

pledging O

conclude O
a O
political O
settlement O
that O
would O
make O
this O
truce O
work O
where O
all O
others O
have O
failed O
. O

But O
then O
he O
apparently O
thought O
better O
of O
it O

Saying O
he O
needed O
to O
tidy O
up O
legal O
loose O
ends O
on O
the O
deal O
-- O
and O
also O
cover O
his O
back O
against O

pro-war O
schemers O
in O
Moscow B-LOC

he O
flew O
back O
to O

empty-handed O

He O
met O
Russian B-LOC

, O
according O
to O
the O
press O
service O
of O
Lebed O

Security B-ORG

, O
could O
meet O
Yeltsin O
on O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
if O
the O
start O

Yeltsin O

announced O

would O

back O

departments O
. O

It O
is O
not O
known O
what O
caused O
the O
delay O
in O
the O
peace O
plan O
. O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed O
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya B-LOC
as O
Yeltsin O
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin O
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed O
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan O
Maskhadov O
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin O
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed O
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
. O

Lebed O
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow B-LOC
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov O
warned O
that O
Lebed O
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian B-LOC
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens B-LOC
say O
-- O
Russian B-LOC
forces O
. O

Maskhadov O
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed O
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin B-LOC
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin O
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya B-LOC
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian B-LOC
Federation I-LOC
-- O
something O
Moscow B-LOC
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North B-LOC
Caucasus I-LOC
. O

Lebed O
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O

the O

" O
These O

I O
have O
much O
more O
fun O
on O
the O
court O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Just O
three O
years O
ago O
Medvedev O
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O
's O
best O
, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French B-LOC
Open I-LOC
semifinal O
and O
winning O
three O
tournaments O
. O

But O
Medvedev O
's O
ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O
year O
as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O
injury O
. O

The O
Ukrainian B-LOC
finally O
hit O
a O
low O
of O
44th O
two O
months O
ago O
. O

" O
It O
's O
somewhere O
where O
I O
would O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
, O
" O
Medvedev O
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
36 O
. O
" O

It O
's O
a O
part O
of O
the O
penalty O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
" O

As O
part O
of O
his O
new O
businesslike O
approach O
, O
Medvedev O
hired O
Australian B-LOC
coach O
Bob O
Brett O
at O
the O
start O
of O
this O
year O
and O
the O
partnership O
is O
beginning O
to O
pay O
off O
. O

" O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
we O
started O
from O
zero O
, O
" O
said O
Medvedev O
. O
" O

Winning O
in O
Long B-LOC
Island I-LOC
( O
last O
week O
) O
was O
like O
winning O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O
" O

While O
Medvedev O
's O
77-minute O
romp O
past O
Fleurian O
was O
rather O
ordinary O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
two O
were O
playing O
each O
other O
was O
rather O
remarkable O
. O

In O
the O
original O
draw O
, O
Medvedev O
and O
Fleurian O
were O
slotted O
to O
play O
each O
other O
. O

When O
controversy O
forced O
the O
draw O
to O
be O
done O
over O
-- O
against O
odds O
of O
151-to-1 O
-- O
Medvedev O
and O
Fleurian O
drew O
each O
other O
a O
second O
time O
. O

" O
When O
I O
saw O
the O
new O
draw O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
change O
my O
preparation O
, O
" O
Medvedev O
said O
. O
" O

I O
think O
it O

destined O
that O
it O
turned O
out O
for O
me O

the O

Dole O
also O
said O
he O
opposed O
California B-LOC

, O
if O
approved O
by O

would O
allow O

Dole O
said O
the O

allow O

be O
used O
for O
anything O
from O
a O

In O
an O

to O
paint O
the O

in O
non-political O

, O
Dole O
said O
three O
times O
during O
his O
20-minute O
address O
that O
illegal O
drug O

was O
neither O
a O
Democratic B-LOC

a O

one O
that O
involves O
all O

The O
anti-drug O

is O
a O
theme O
Dole O
feels O
has O
strong O
voter O
appeal O

On O
Sunday O
near O
Chicago B-LOC
he O
accused O
President O

" O

" O
in O

. O

A O
recent O
survey O
showed O
that O
illegal O

among O
12-17 O
year-olds O
had O
doubled O
in O
the O

four O

Dole O
was O
flanked O

The O

the O

its O

Kubo O

" O
The O
question O
is O

" O
I O
do O

we O

a O
conclusion O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O

British B-LOC
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford B-ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature B-ORG
saying O
it O
would O

any O

" O
National B-ORG
Farmers I-ORG
Union I-ORG
president O
Sir O
David O
Naish O
told O
BBC B-ORG
radio I-ORG
. O

Naish O
said O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
Britain B-LOC
to O
carry O
out O
a O
planned O
cull O
of O
some O
147,000 O
cattle O
to O
which O
it O
had O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
placate O
its O
European B-LOC
partners O
. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O
animals O
being O
culled O
if O
in O
fact O
scientists O
throughout O
Europe B-LOC
accepted O
this O
evidence O
, O
" O
Naish O
said O
. O

The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O
a O
damaging O
row O
between O
Britain B-LOC
and O
the O
EU B-ORG
, O
which O
slapped O
a O
worldwide O
ban O

after O
the O

said O
there O
could O
be O
a O

between O

The O
issue O
flared O
in O

O.J. O
Simpson O
said O
on O
Thursday O
he O
was O
financially O
broken O
by O
his O
defence O
against O
murder O
charges O
but O
he O
was O
hopeful O
new O
evidence O
to O
support O
him O
would O
be O
available O
for O
a O
civil O
trial O
next O
month O
. O

The O
former O
football O
star O
was O
found O
not O
guilty O
by O
a O
criminal O
trial O
jury O
last O
October O
of O
the O
murders O
of O
his O
former O
wife O
, O
Nicole O
Brown O
Simpson O
, O
and O
her O
friend O
, O
Ronald O
Goldman O
, O
in O
June O
1994 O
. O

He O
now O
faces O
a O
civil O
suit O
brought O
by O
families O
of O
the O
victims O
who O
hold O
him O
responsible O
for O
the O
deaths O
. O

He O
told O
reporters O
a O
court O
order O
not O
to O
talk O
about O
his O
case O
kept O
him O
from O
detailing O
how O
he O
has O
fulfilled O
his O
pledge O
to O
find O
the O
killers O
. O

But O
he O
added O
without O
elaborating O
, O
" O
hopefully O
we O
will O
see O
some O
things O
come O
out O
in O
this O
next O
trial O
. O
" O

The O
judge O
in O
the O
civil O
trial O
has O
imposed O
a O
sweeping O
gag O
order O
that O
prohibits O
lawyers O
, O
witnesses O
and O
parties O
to O
the O
case O
from O
discussing O
it O
with O
the O
media O
or O
elsewhere O
in O
public O
. O

" O
I O
would O
love O
to O
speak O
about O
everything O
, O
" O
said O
Simpson O
, O
who O
vowed O
after O
his O
acquittal O
to O
find O
the O
killers O
and O
offered O
a O
substantial O
reward O
. O

His O
lawyers O
have O
said O
his O
defence O
in O
the O
civil O
trial O
that O
starts O
Sept O
. O

17 O
will O
be O
that O
he O
did O
not O
kill O
the O
victims O
. O

Simpson O
said O
at O
the O
hotel O
news O
conference O
his O
plans O
include O
eventually O
writing O
another O
book O
. O

He O
added O
that O
he O
has O
had O
job O
offers O
but O
more O
have O
come O
from O
abroad O
than O
at O
home O
. O

" O
I O

. O

I O
am O
not O
crying O
the O
blues O
. O

I O
can O
get O
along O
just O
fine O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O

Whatever O
you O
want O
to O
send O
me O
, O
I O
need O
. O
" O

He O
again O
accused O
the O
news O
media O
of O
erroneous O
reporting O
on O
his O
case O
but O
did O
not O
signal O
any O
plans O
for O

as O
he O
did O
on O
Wednesday O
in O
an O
address O

, O
Simpson O
said O
, O
he O
has O
received O
support O
from O
both O
blacks O
and O

He O
again O
dismissed O
charges O
that O
he O
had O
distanced O
himself O
from O
the O
black O
community O
during O
his O
successful O

that O
it O

probably O

it O

" O

" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O

is O
the O
first O

has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O

equally O
we O

" O

Against O

Hope O
said O
the O

was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O

destocked O
even O

this O

had O
slipped O
to O
9.5 O
percent O

11.3 O

. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
've O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
sold O
the O
( O

actually O

bad O

" O
It O
does O
show O
how O
easily O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
bounce O
back O
over O
10 O
percent O
again O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
We O
continue O
to O
feel O
very O
relaxed O
about O
our O
general O
view O
that O
we O
would O
average O
10 O
percent O

margins O
over O
the O

. O
" O

" O
We O
've O
always O
taken O
the O

that O
we O

the O

" O
When O

Speculation O
that O

percent O

the O
tough O

had O
prevented O
Zywiec B-ORG

raising O

such O
a O

be O
exaggerated O

the O

that O
Zywiec B-ORG

The O

refer O
the O

. O

Trade B-ORG

Industry I-ORG
Secretary O
Ian O
Lang O
added O
that O
even O
if O
the O
conditions O
were O
met O
by O
both O
airlines O
, O
final O
clearance O
would O
hinge O
on O
an O
open O

deal O
between O
Britain B-LOC
and O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
to O
liberalise O
trans-Atlantic B-LOC
air O

, O
which O
would O
create O
greater O
competition O
on O
the O

. O

Lang O
said O
he O
supported O
conditions O
proposed O
by O
Britain B-LOC

of I-ORG
Fair I-ORG
Trading I-ORG
, O
which O
was O
asked O
to O
examine O
the O
case O
last O
month O
. O

" O
I O
agree O
... O
that O
without O
suitable O
undertakings O
the O
alliance O
would O
be O
likely O
to O
lead O
to O
a O
significant O
loss O
of O
actual O
and O
potential O
passengers O
, O
on O
those O
routes O
where O
BA B-ORG

currently O
compete O
and O
for O
all O

on O
the O

UK B-LOC

" O
he O
said O

His O
comments O
came O
just O

after O
the O
latest O
set O
of O
open O

ended O
in O
London B-LOC

Industry O
sources O
said O
there O
was O
no O
new O
date O
for O
fresh O

blamed O
the O
deadlock O
on O
uncertainty O
over O
whether O
the O
British B-LOC
Airways-American I-LOC
deal O
would O
be O
cleared O
. O

The O
conditions O
for O
clearance O
of O
the O
alliance O
were O
that O
British B-ORG

and O
American B-ORG
drop O
168 O

it O

view O
the O

" O

" O

However O
, O
it O
called O
the O
conditions O
" O
more O
severe O
" O
than O
those O
imposed O
by O
other O
regulatory O
authorities O
on O
similar O
airline O
alliances O
. O

British B-ORG
Airways I-ORG
's O
initial O
response O
was O
that O
" O
unconditional O
divestiture O
of O
slots O
is O
unprecedented O
and O
if O
done O
it O
must O
be O
on O
the O
basis O
of O

" O

It O
added O
that O
it O
would O
be O
" O
prepared O
to O
take O
reasonable O
steps O
to O
assist O
the O
introduction O
of O

. O
" O

The O

also O
wants O
British B-ORG

to O
drop O
a O
clause O
in O
its O
agreement O
with O
USAir B-ORG
that O
bars O
it O
from O

, O
and O
said O
both O
British B-ORG

should O
be O

reduce O

in O
the O
event O
that O

who O

General O

the O

told O
him O
the O
crisis O
was O
over O
because O
most O
of O
the O

have O
already O

. O

The O

do O
not O
want O
the O

to O
deploy O
on O
the O
ground O

for O
fear O

as O
though O

( O

are O
going O

Plastic O

The O

" O
We O

the O

from O

" O

A O

Hakme O
attributes O
Brazil B-LOC

fascination O
with O

not O
to O
excessive O

to O
the O

The O

to O
wriggle O
out O

two O
sets O
down O
in O
the O

against O
Todd O

in O
the O

O'Brien O
, O
a O
winner O
two O

in O

Haven I-LOC
for O
his O
first O
pro O

served O
for O
the O
match O
at O
5-4 O
in O
the O
third O

before O

charging O
back O

" O
I O
just O

" O
said O
the O
26-year-old O
O'Brien O
, O
ranked O
65th O

" O
I O
kept O
my O
composure O
and O
I O
was O
proud O
of O
myself O
for O
that O
-- O
usually O
I O
would O
have O
folded O
up O
the O

gone O
home O
. O
" O

The O
hard-serving O
O'Brien O
, O
a O
former O
U.S. B-LOC
collegiate O
national O
champion O
, O
fired O
up O
17 O
aces O
to O
ultimately O
subdue O
the O
never-say-die O
Washington O
. O

The O
fifth O
set O
stayed O
on O
serve O
until O
the O
sixth O
game O
, O
when O
Washington O
, O
after O
saving O
one O
break O
point O
with O
a O
forehand O
winner O
down O
the O
line O
, O
netted O
a O
backhand O
to O
give O
O'Brien O
a O
4-2 O

The O
Texan B-LOC
blasted O
in O
two O
aces O
to O
hold O

at O
5-2 O
and O
then O
converted O
his O
eighth O
match O
point O
for O
victory O
when O
Washington O
found O
the O

with O
another O
backhand O
from O

" O

" O

Tarango O

I O

" O

" O
We O

" O

The O
Agriculture B-ORG

proposed O

than O

to O
significantly O
ease O

the O

be O
opened O
into O

. O

The O
plan O
has O
raised O
a O
storm O
of O
protest O
from O
U.S. B-LOC
avocado O
growers O
, O
who O
are O
largely O
concentrated O
in O
California B-LOC

California B-LOC
growers O
have O
charged O
that O
removing O
the O
restrictions O
, O
even O
on O
a O
limited O
basis O
, O
would O
endanger O
the O
$ O
1 O

if O
potentially O

insects O
were O
brought O

. O

Mexican B-LOC
officials O
contend O
that O
there O
is O
no O
scientific O
basis O
for O
the O

and O
that O
it O
is O
illegal O
under O
international O

Proponents O

the O

discount O
the O
worries O
of O
the O
U.S. B-LOC

and O
say O
the O
plan O
has O
enough O
safeguards O
built O
into O
it O
to O
eliminate O
any O
significant O
threat O
to O
American B-LOC
producers O
. O

Under O
the O

" O

I O
