of 0	0

would 0	0

on 0	0

right 0	0

about 0	0

n't 0	0
really 0	0

that 0	0

I 0	0
know 0	0
CEO/chair 0	0
duality 0	0
is 0	0
a 0	0
popular 0	0
cause 0	0
for 0	0
corporate 0	0

. 0	0

However 0	0
there 0	0
is 0	0
little 0	0
empirical 0	0
evidence 0	0
to 0	0
suggest 0	0
that 0	0
separating 0	0
these 0	0

affects 0	0
firm 0	0
performance 0	0
in 0	0
either 0	0
a 0	0
positive 0	0
or 0	0
negative 0	0
way 0	0
. 0	0

Having 0	0
a 0	0
combined 0	0

does 0	0
reduce 0	0
the 0	0
ability 0	0

the 0	0

act 0	0
as 0	0
a 0	0
