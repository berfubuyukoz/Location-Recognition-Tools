ahmedabad
:
there
is
something
more
sinister
about
the
communal
violence
that
the
city
has
witnessed
over
the
past
week
than
what
the
bjp
government
is
letting
on
as
of
now
.

but
with
two
persons
killed
in
police
firing
and
the
culmination
of
ganesh
festivities
scheduled
on
saturday
,
the
administration
is
all
geared
up
for
an
escalation
and
a
possible
spread
of
violence
.

he
,
however
,
said
there
was
`
`
no
visible
pattern
'
'
behind
the
communal
trouble
witnessed
in
Ahmedabad
so
far
and
that
the
two
flare-ups
in
Dariapur
last
week
and
Shahpur
on
wednesday
night
were
`
`
not
inter-connected
'
'
.

the
authorities
at
present
seem
rather
confused
about
the
motive
behind
the
low-intensity
violence
that
is
taking
place
in
Ahmedabad
and
believe
it
has
the
potential
to
spread
to
other
areas
and
even
flare
up
.

while
a
delegation
of
muslims
led
by
congressmen
met
minister
of
state
for
home
haren
pandya
on
thursday
,
protesting
against
lethal
police
firing
during
the
clashes
,
the
officials
felt
the
leadership
of
the
minority
community
was
no
longer
in
the
hands
of
the
main
opposition
party
.
`
`
this
is
a
hypothesis
which
has
been
given
to
us
by
the
intelligence
agencies
and
we
would
like
the
government
to
interact
with
a
wider
representation
of
the
community
,
'
'
subba
rao
said
.

however
,
the
government
believes
that
the
current
spell
of
violence
may
not
be
related
to
the
coming
byelections
to
sabarkantha
and
sabarmati
because
there
is
not
much
of
a
muslim
votebank
in
these
two
constituencies

reopened

with

ending
their
fortnight-long

see

what
with

us

every

"
remarked

it
is
still
not
clear
whether
the
students
,
who
have
already
lost
precious
two
weeks
because
of
the

,
would
be
delivered
another
blow
with

where
is
the
buzz
of
busy
classrooms
if
the

have
indeed
withdrawn
their

you
wonder
